# Estimands in machine learning algorithm evaluation




---

## Literature review

In the literature review ... analysis of how estimands are currently specified in the applied machine learning literature

## Pubmed extraction

what are the scripts doing...

- literature_review_funs.R
- literature_review_init.R
- literature_review_prep.R
- literature_review_extract.R
- literature_review_annotation.R: The file literature_review_annotation produces a folder "annotation" within the files folder.




## Technical preparation

Within the created folder estimands_in_ml/literature_review/annotation the pubmed results are stored. The annotation workflow, consists of the following steps:

1. copy annotation folder and save as **annotation_xy/** where xy indicates the annotators (i.e. your) initials.
2. Within the **annotation/** folder, there is one subfolder for each year included in the analysis, i.e. **annotation/yyyy/**
3. For each each included year folder, there are two subfolders:
4. **annotation/yyyy/match** (matching )
5. **annotation/yyyy/nomatch**

The CSV in the **match** folder should be annotated as described below.
An identical second version ("..._2.csv") only deviates by the column delimiter.
ONLY ONE FILE, *annotation_yyyy_match.csv* OR *annotation_yyyy_match_2.csv*, needs to be annotated.

## Annotation workflow

The goal of this review is to judge the empirical estimand of each study. 
(Exception: if outlook_only = yes, then the proposed estimand for future work.)
What parts should be read for each paper? 
Abstract $\rightarrow$ Methods $\rightarrow$ Tables/Figures $\rightarrow$ Discussion/conclusion ($\rightarrow$ potentially other parts, optional).
For all fields, the default value is "" (empty cell). 

### Basic info (BASIC)

- exclude (default: no | 1: yes): should the entry be excluded? (judged based on the title and abstract only, target population of papers: development and/or validation of clinical risk prediction models)
-	no_pdf (default: no | 1: yes): is there no PDF full text available? 


### Study description (STUDY)

-	val_only (default: no | 1: yes): is the study only dealing with an external (model/algo) validation, i.e. was the model/algo development carried out in an earlier study?
-	exp_design (default: NA| free text otherwise; OPTIONAL) specification of the experimental design (e.g. “leave-one-clinic out”, “custom CV”, random T-V-E split) for the discussed estimand 


### Categorization of estimand (ESTIMAND)

Coding for all but two variables in this category: (default: no | 1: applies to present study | 2: applies to outlook | 3: applies to both, present study and outlook))

-	unconditional (default: no | 1: yes): is the study concerned with model evaluation (conditional on training data; i.e. single training run (per model); the default) or algorithm evaluation (training repeated over different training datasets; unconditional = 1)?
-	estimand_rdm: the empirical estimand is not structured but rather relies on random data splitting
-	estimand_vague: the evaluation involves external data (another cohort) without exact specification what the empirical estimand is (i.e. none of the descriptions below apply)
-	transport_site: is the estimand concerned with transportability to different (clinical) sites?
-	transport_region: is the estimand concerned with transportability to different regions (e.g. countries)?
-	transport_time: is the estimand concerned with transportability to different time periods?
-	transport_process: is the estimand concerned with transportability to different processes (e.g. measurement devices/protocols).
-	transport_setting: is the estimand concerned with transportability to different settings (e.g., intensive care to normal care unit) or population / covariate shift (e.g., adults to children)?
-	overlap (default: no | 1: yes) does (partial) overlap occur between different estimand aspect in the present study (i.e., between two or more transport_xyz fields)? “no” implies that estimand aspects can be clearly distinguished in the study/data sample. “yes” implies that this is not the case (e.g., one hospital for each of 5 countries, that is the transportability between regions and between hospitals cannot be distinguished). Should be set to 1/“yes” even if this problem only occurs partially (e.g. 3 clinics in Germany, 1 clinic in Switzerland, 1 clinic in Italy). If overlap is 1/”yes”, at least 2 transpost_xyz fields should be 1/”yes”. If needed, details can be explained in “remarks” field.


### Other fields (OTHER)

-	done (default: no | 1: yes): mostly meant as a progress tracker for the annotator.
-	remark (default: NA | free text otherwise): any remark from the annotator (e.g. details on estimand or estimator definition)


## Remarks on annotation workflow

In case multiple estimands are described/estimated in the study, this should be specified as a remark. All aspects/dimensions considered by any of the estimands should be annotated as such. In this case, the overlap field should be "yes", if there is overlap is true for one of the estimands.  

If a publication is excluded but relevant from a methodological perspective, please annotate as exclude=1 and add a corresponding remark, e.g. "relevant methodological work".

If exclude = 1, no further fields should be annotated except (done=1).
